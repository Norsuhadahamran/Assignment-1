Overview in ICT jobs in Industry with AirAsia

# executive summary
I have heard the sharing shared by Mr. Shadrul and Mr. Danial about their experience working at AirAsia.
From the sharing from Mr. Shardul, the manager, Software Engineering AirAsia, I was interested in the internship opportunities given to prospective software engineering graduates from UTM which gives them the opportunity to gain experience at AirAsia. The job opportunities given in the field of software engineering are frontend developer, backend developer, DevOps/SRE, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Tester and Business Analyst. The typical day-to-day activities of a software engineer in AirAsia, including daily stand-ups, code reviews, and the importance of well-defined processes.
Working culture in AirAsia is very different from the working culture in other places, they practice "No Sir culture" where they do not call Sir or Madam even though they have a high rank, they only call by name because AirAsia considers "all employees are stars". so if no sir culture i think we will start comfort with everyone and easy to share any idea and feedback each other. Through the sharing from Mr. Danial, the Head of Software Engineering AirAsia also attracted my attention. Mr. Danial shared that he has working experience in software engineering for 20 years and said that working at AirAsia is the best experience because working in the department can work from home where when WFH we can arrange our time without having to be tied to working hours. En Danial shared that when WFH we can be more flexible in our time and no morning commute, but WFH also give bad impact it is because when WFH it is hard to connect with your coworkers, it is less productive and less accountability. Therefore, Mr. Danial shared WFH tips such as first, designated physical workspace. Second, set up a routine, your morning ritual. Third is communication, use all the channels of communication and always pick up the phone and call. Forth is to avoid meeting fatigue, block your calendar, i.e. Lunch. Fifth is reserved time for social interaction with your coworkers and lastly is switch off at the end of the day.
